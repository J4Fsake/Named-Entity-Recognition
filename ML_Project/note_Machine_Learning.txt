Problem Type: Multi-class Classification  
Goal: Identify traffic type and detect VPN usage using flow-based features.  
Models: SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
Evaluation: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix  
Outcome: Analyze encrypted flows and detect VPN activity.  
Note:  Pay attention to class imbalance and scaling.
